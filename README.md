# Spa Dog :dog:

A website where you can organize yourself with a to-do list, where you can complete your "todos" and delete them at the end of the day. :tada:

&nbsp;

## The Background Behind This Project :open_book:

This is my first javascript project, so a to do list is perfect for someone who is new to javascript. I wanted the website to look very prominent, so I used a lot of he box-shadow property, transition and animation. :blush:

## What I learned :brain:

- Heavily focused on the `design` and `Javascript`
- To combine colors and images so they fit well together
- Worked a lot with `linear-gradient`
- How to creat a `function` and use them
- The `if/else` Statement
